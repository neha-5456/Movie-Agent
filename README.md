# Movie-Agent
The AI Movie Assistant is an intelligent conversational agent built using LangChain, OpenAI, and the TMDB (The Movie Database) API. It allows users to query information about movies in natural language, and the assistant fetches and responds with accurate data like plot summaries, release dates, ratings, and more.
